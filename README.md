## Bobo PlugIns for Beginners


</div>

### Description

A PlugIn is a dll/exe/script that is installed separately from an application that can perform tasks within that application. It should be able to pass objects freely between the application and the plugin. This is in response to a number of questions in the Discussion Forums - you know, the place no-one ever goes and questions never get answered !!
